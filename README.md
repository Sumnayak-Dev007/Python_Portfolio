# Snake Game in Python
URL : https://sumoon.itch.io/snake-game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python library Tkinter. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the screen borders or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the score increases.
