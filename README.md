# Snake Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python library Tkinter. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the screen borders or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the score increases.

# Features
<b>Snake Movement:</b> The snake moves in four possible directions (up, down, left, right).<br><br>
<b>Score Tracking:</b> The score increases each time the snake eats food.<br><br>
<b>Collision Detection:</b> The game ends when the snake collides with the screen border or its own body.<br><br>
<b>Random Food Generation:</b> Food is placed at random locations on the game board after every consumption.<br><br>
<b>Simple GUI:</b>The game is built using the Tkinter library, providing a graphical user interface for interaction.<br><br>
